# Drone Dogs
## SDEV140 Spring 2021 Project
### By Daniel Clancy

This is the repo for the DroneDogs project for my SDEV140 class at Ivy Tech.

To build/test this project make sure you have Node.js installed. This is a ReactJS/ElectronJS app.

Once you have Node.js installed you can use 

`npm i` 

to install the dependecies inside the project folder.

Once the dependencies are installed you can use

`npm start` 

to run the dev server for the app.

To build the app for your specific platform (Windows, MacOS, Linux) use

`npm run make`

in the project folder.
